## Technologies Used

## Structure

The application consists of the following key components:

- TaskInput: Provides a form for adding new tasks

## Usage

1. Add a new task using the input field and submit button
2. Mark a task as completed by clicking a checkbox next to it
3. Delete a task by clicking on a delete button
4. Tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage, so they will persist even after page refresh
